# RPNCalculator

This is a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator made for the final project for my Object-Oriented Programming class at Virginia Tech in the Fall 1997 semester.

I did the back end, implementing calculations, including arithmetic over the complex numbers.

Mike Melton did the bulk of the front end, including the parser for the graphing utility.
